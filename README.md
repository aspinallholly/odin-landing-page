# Odin Project - Landing Page
A responsive landing page created as part of The Odin Project.

## Description

The project is a simple landing page with some filler text.

The webpage is currently written purely in HTML and CSS.
It makes fairly extensive use of FlexBox in order to align items on
the page correctly.

### Challenges

To date, the biggest challenges have been ensuring everything is 
responsive on smaller devices, as well as learning how to make the CSS
cleaner.

### Future Plans

In its current form, it does not link to other webpages but the plan
is to implement these. I also plan to add JavaScript to the webpage(s)
once I have at least a working knowledge of this.
